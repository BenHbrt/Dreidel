# Dreidel

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About the project

The inspiration for this project came simply from the time of year. I wanted to code something festive and seasonal, and as I like cooking latkes, I knew that Hanukkah was approaching, and so decided to code a dreidel game!

## The tech side of things

I decided to write this project using the React library, as it was clear to me that it lends itself to the use of components for the different days, as thy all needed to behave in the same way. I chose to use SCSS for the styling, as it allows for nested syntax, thus making it much easier to write.
